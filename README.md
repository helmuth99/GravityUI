# GravityUI x CronixUI 2.0

We are happy to announce that CronixUI is officially now GravityUI. The beloved CronixUI moved away from ElvUI and build a high performant version of the CronixUI.
GravityUI is a full UI option build ontop of multiple popular addons. It supports all classes and specs and includes many custom frames, sounds, media and font options.

To open the installer manuelly use any of these chat commands: /cui, /CUI, /GUI, /gui

**Supports:**

-   Currently we only tested it for retail
-   It was build on a 1440p monitor, other resolutions will follow.

# Features

-   Custom fonts, sound and media files.
-   DPS/Tank and Healer profile setup.
-   Custom theme and style
-   Twink installation for easy setup on Twinks **[Upcoming]**

# Known Issues

-   OmniCD profile is currendly optimised for DPS only, update is planned.
